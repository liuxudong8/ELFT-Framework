## ðŸŒŒ The Vision

Why are there so many fundamental constants in physics? Where do they come from?

The Electromagnetic-like Field Theory (ELFT) project dares to propose an answer: **what if constants like mass, permittivity, and permeability are not fixed inputs, but dynamic products of more fundamental fields?**

This project explores a radical paradigm shiftâ€”unifying the description of spacetime geometry and matter fields through a pair of coupled fields \((\psi, \mathbf{B})\), analogous to but extending beyond classical electromagnetism.

## ðŸ§© Project Modules

This repository is structured into two core modules:

- **`Module-1_Foundation/`**: The formal theoretical framework of ELFT.
- **`Module-2_Application/`** (Coming Soon): Applying ELFT to explain the galaxy rotation curve without dark matter.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Explore the foundation of the theory:
```bash
cd Module-1_Foundation
