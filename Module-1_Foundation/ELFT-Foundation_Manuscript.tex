\begin{abstract}
    This manuscript presents the foundational framework of the Electromagnetic-like Field Theory (ELFT). By introducing a scalar field $\psi$ and a vector field $\mathbf{B}$ as fundamental descriptors of spacetime, we construct a Lagrangian density from which field equations analogous to those of Maxwell and Klein-Gordon are naturally derived. This framework suggests a unified geometric origin for properties traditionally considered separate, such as mass and spacetime curvature, potentially offering new pathways toward the unification of physical interactions.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation: The Problem of Constants}
The origin of the fundamental constants of physics (e.g., $c$, $G$, $\varepsilon_0$) remains one of the most profound open questions. Are they truly fixed, or could they be emergent properties of a deeper dynamical structure? The ELFT is conceived from the proposition that the latter may be true.

\section{The Fundamental Fields and Lagrangian}

\subsection{Definition of Core Fields}
The theory is built upon two primary fields defined on spacetime:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A scalar field $\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$
    \item A vector field $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t)$, termed the \textit{proto-magnetic} field
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Lagrangian Formulation}
The dynamics of the system are governed by the following Lagrangian density:
\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V(\mathbf{r}) - E(\mathbf{r},t) = \frac{1}{2}m_0 \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - \psi(\mathbf{r},t)^2 - V(\mathbf{r})
\]
where $V(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t)^2$ is identified as an effective potential.

\subsection{From Particle Action to Field Equations}
Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the particle Lagrangian:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial r_i} = 0
\]
yields the equation of motion:
\begin{equation}
m_0 \ddot{\mathbf{r}} + 2\psi \nabla \psi + \nabla V = 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Analogy with Established Field Theories}

\subsection{The Klein-Gordon Connection}
By transitioning from a particle description to a field description, promoting $\psi$ to a relativistic field, we can derive a Klein-Gordon-type equation:
\begin{equation}
\left( \Box - k^2 \right)\psi = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\Box$ is the d'Alembertian operator.

\subsection{Tensor Formulation and Maxwell Analogy}
We define an antisymmetric tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ analogous to the electromagnetic field tensor:
\[
F^{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -\psi_x/c & -\psi_y/c & -\psi_z/c \\
\psi_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\
\psi_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\
\psi_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
This allows us to write the field equations in a compact, covariant form reminiscent of Maxwell's equations.

\section{Coupling to Spacetime Geometry: Towards a Unified Picture}
\label{sec:gr_coupling}

The ELFT framework, thus far formulated in a flat spacetime background, reveals structures deeply reminiscent of both electromagnetism and relativistic field theory. A natural and profound extension is to inquire how the fields $(\psi, \mathbf{B})$ couple to the dynamics of spacetime itself—the domain of general relativity.

\subsection{The Covariant Lagrangian and the Gravitational Sector}
To incorporate gravity, we promote the Lagrangian density to a generally covariant form. The central object is the scalar density constructed from the field tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{1}{4\mu(r,t)} F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} \sqrt{-g},
\end{equation}
where $g = \det(g_{\mu\nu})$ is the determinant of the metric tensor, and $\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x$ is the invariant spacetime volume element. The spacetime dependence of $\mu(r,t)$ is now elevated to a functional dependence on the metric and the fundamental fields, $\mu \equiv \mu[g_{\mu\nu}, \psi]$.

\subsection{The Emergent Energy-Momentum Tensor}
Variation of the action $S = \int \mathcal{L}_{\text{grav}} \, d^4x$ with respect to the metric yields a generalized energy-momentum tensor:
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{\mu(r,t)} \left( F_{\mu\alpha}F_{\nu}^{\;\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\mu\nu} F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta} \right).
\end{equation}
This tensor sources the curvature of spacetime via the Einstein field equations, $G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}$, where $\kappa = 8\pi G/c^4$.

\subsection{A Geometric Interpretation of the Field Invariant}
The scalar $F^{\alpha\beta}F_{\alpha\beta}$ plays a pivotal role. In our theory, it evaluates to:
\begin{equation}
F^{\alpha\beta}F_{\alpha\beta} = 2\left(B^2 - \frac{\psi^2}{c^2}\right) \equiv \lambda_1.
\end{equation}
This invariant $\lambda_1$ intertwines the proto-magnetic and scalar fields. In highly symmetric spacetimes (e.g., isotropic, static), this structure can lead to an effective description where the Einstein tensor is proportional to the metric:
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} = \lambda\, g_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a scalar function of the fields, $\lambda \propto -\lambda_1 / \mu(r,t)$. This describes an \textit{Einstein manifold}, a spacetime where matter itself dictates a conformal relationship between curvature and metric.

\subsection{Mass as a Dynamic Consequence of Spacetime}
The core hypothesis of ELFT—that mass originates from the field $\psi$ via $m \propto (\psi/c)^2$—finds its natural completion in this geometric picture. The spacetime-varying permittivity $\varepsilon(r,t)$ and permeability $\mu(r,t)$ are no longer fixed background properties but become dynamic attributes of the metric-$(\psi, \mathbf{B})$ system. Consequently, the mass of an object is not an immutable parameter but a dynamic quantity emerging from its interaction with the local spacetime geometry described by this unified field complex.

This coupling provides a theoretical pathway to address phenomena like the galaxy rotation curve anomaly not by postulating dark matter, but by considering how the large-scale distribution of $\psi$ and $\mathbf{B}$ modifies the effective gravitational potential and mass content through the equations presented above.

\section{Discussion and Outlook}
The ELFT framework presented here demonstrates that a theory built upon the fields $(\psi, \mathbf{B})$ can naturally reproduce structures central to modern physics. The coupling to spacetime geometry outlined in Section~\ref{sec:gr_coupling} opens promising avenues for addressing long-standing problems in astrophysics and cosmology without resorting to dark matter hypotheses.

Future work will focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deriving explicit solutions for the field equations in symmetric spacetimes.
    \item Developing the quantum field theoretic formulation of ELFT.
    \item Confronting the model with high-precision astrophysical data.
\end{itemize}

The unification of electromagnetic-like fields with gravity through this framework suggests a deeper connection between the fundamental interactions, potentially paving the way toward a complete theory of quantum gravity.
